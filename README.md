#   Bookmark management system API

This is a Bookmark managment system built with Flask API

## Overview
A bookmark API is a web-based application programming interface that allows users to manage their bookmarks. This API provides a set of endpoints that enable users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their bookmarks.With a bookmark API, users can create, store, retrieve, update, and delete bookmarks.
The bookmark API can be used in a variety of applications, such as web browsers, mobile apps, or bookmark manager tools. For example, a web browser can use the bookmark API to sync bookmarks across multiple devices, while a bookmark manager tool can use the API to provide a unified interface for managing bookmarks from different sources.

## Security and privacy
Security is an important consideration for a bookmark API, as it involves sensitive user data. This API support authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify their bookmarks. Additionally, the API should use HTTPS encryption to secure the data in transit.
